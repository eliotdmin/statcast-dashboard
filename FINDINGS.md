# Findings

A dated log of what has been tested, what the number was, and what it does and
does not show. Append; do not rewrite. A finding that turns out wrong gets a new
entry that supersedes the old one, with both left visible — the record of what
was believed and why is the point.

Every entry follows the same shape: **Question / Result / What it shows / What it
does not show / Next.**

## 2026-09-10 — Does xwOBA actually predict better than wOBA?

This is the premise the entire dashboard rests on, and it had never been run.

**Question.** Out of sample, does period-1 xwOBA predict period-2 wOBA better
than period-1 wOBA does?

**Result.** Yes, in 12 of 12 season × window combinations, with bootstrap
intervals excluding zero in every one.

| season | Δr @15d | @30d | @45d | @60d | β partial range |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2023 | +0.059 | +0.061 | +0.101 | +0.054 | 0.16 – 0.33 |
| 2024 | +0.085 | +0.073 | +0.087 | +0.087 | 0.25 – 0.36 |
| 2025 | +0.089 | +0.098 | +0.104 | +0.137 | 0.22 – 0.43 |

**What it shows.** Contact quality carries information beyond what a player's own
results already told you. `β partial` is the standardized coefficient on xwOBA1 in
`wOBA2 ~ wOBA1 + xwOBA1`, so it is free of the shared-term coupling that makes
naive versions of this test look impressive when nothing is there. At 0.22–0.43
it is a real independent contribution.

**What it does not show.** That the future is predictable. The absolute
correlations are 0.10–0.33 — contact quality beats results at forecasting a
short window, and a short window is still mostly noise. Read the dashboard as
"who is mispriced," not "who is about to break out." Survivorship bias remains
uncorrected: benched players vanish from period 2.

**Next.** Re-run including 2026 once the season completes. Consider whether the
150 PA gate is right; metrics stabilise at different rates and one threshold
cannot be correct for all of them.

## 2026-09-10 — How large is the speed effect on the luck gap?

The README asserts that fast hitters persistently out-hit their xwOBA and that
the model will keep flagging them as regression candidates. That assertion had
never been measured.

**Question.** How much of a hitter's luck gap is explained by sprint speed?

**Result.** Coefficient −0.00093 wOBA per ft/s, R² = 0.0034, n = 389 (2026 only).
Across the full observed range of 22.1 to 30.5 ft/s that is about **8 points of
wOBA between the slowest hitter in baseball and the fastest**. With n=389 and
that R², the coefficient is not statistically distinguishable from zero
(F ≈ 1.3, p ≈ 0.25). The largest correction to any player's z-score is 0.17,
and seven of the ten largest movers are catchers.

**What it shows.** The sign is right — faster hitters do have more negative luck
gaps. The magnitude is far smaller than the README implies, and below the noise
the flagging threshold operates in.

**What it does not show.** That the effect is absent. One partial season,
range-restricted (the slowest players do not reach 150 PA), and fitted as a
straight line when the relationship may only exist in the 29+ ft/s tail.

**Next.** Backfill sprint speed for 2023–2025 (`backfill.py` now does this) and
refit on four seasons. If the coefficient stays this small, delete
`outlook_adj` rather than carrying an unused feature. The README's companion
claim about shift-beaters is separately untested and the 2023 rule change gives
a natural experiment.

**Status.** `outlook_adj` is computed and displayed but NOT used for flagging,
pending the four-season refit.

## 2026-09-10 — Does changing the pitch make it harder to hit?

**Question.** Is a pitch harder to hit when it differs from the pitch before it?

**Result.** No — the reverse. Changing the pitch is worth **0.60 runs per 100
less** to the pitcher than repeating it, and produces **1.26 fewer whiffs per
100**, across 2.07M paired pitches, holding the count fixed.

The count was the obvious confound and it is not the explanation: adjusting for
it makes the gap *wider* than the raw comparison. The penalty roughly doubles in
two-strike counts (1-2: −1.13, 2-2: −1.07). It survives conditioning on what the
previous pitch did — negative after a ball (−0.65), a called strike (−0.52), a
foul (−0.23), and a whiff (−0.66).

Two supporting cuts: whiff rate on offspeed following a fastball peaks at a
6–11 mph velocity drop and declines beyond it, so bigger gaps do not help more;
and consecutive fastballs get *more* effective, not less (first −0.32,
second +0.32, third +0.43 rv/100).

**What it shows.** A robust description: in four seasons, pitches that repeat
outperform pitches that change, within every count and every previous-pitch
outcome.

**What it does not show.** That any given pitcher should repeat more. Sequence is
chosen, not assigned. Pitchers with one dominant pitch repeat it, and those
repeats are good because the pitch is good. Pitchers already change about two
thirds of the time, so observed repeats are the ones they were most confident in.

**Next.** The causal question needs within-pitcher variation — compare a pitcher
to himself, holding count and previous outcome fixed. The useful question is not
"should pitchers mix more" but **"are there specific pitchers who mix too much"**,
which this database can answer and which is a genuinely novel angle.

## 2026-09-10 — Three data conventions that were silently wrong

Each of these came from an integrity check that asserted textbook behaviour and
failed against the actual database. None were known when the check was written.

**xwOBA now carries non-contact events.** `estimated_woba_using_speedangle` is
populated on PA-ending strikeouts (0.000), walks (0.698) and HBP (0.729) — the
long-standing public understanding is that it is NULL there. Consequence: a null
check is no longer a batted-ball filter; use `type = 'X'`. `analyze.is_bip` was
using the null check and was counting strikeouts as balls in play. `xBA` and
`xSLG` still follow the old convention, so two columns in the same row disagree.
Verified consistent across all four seasons, so there is no cross-season break.

**Bat tracking exists from July 2023.** Zero rows before 2023-07, then continuous
coverage. The public announcement was May 2024; Savant back-processed the 2023
second half. Distributions are indistinguishable across seasons (mean bat speed
69.6 in 2023 vs 69.5 in 2024), so the older data is usable. Two artefacts: the
maximum is exactly 88.0 mph in all four seasons, which is a clamp rather than a
physical limit, and ~0.5% of values fall under 20 mph, which are failed reads.

**The strike zone changes definition in 2026.** `sz_top`/`sz_bot` were
operator-set per pitch through 2025 and are ABS-defined from batter height from
2026. Distinct `sz_top` values: 348,556 in 2025 against 390 in 2026. Every
zone-derived metric — zone rate, chase rate, called-strike rate, edge command,
catcher framing — has a **measurement** discontinuity at 2026, not a behavioural
one. Framing value should collapse toward zero in 2026 by construction. This is
the most dangerous thing in the dataset for anyone pooling seasons.

## 2026-09-10 — Data completeness

2.84M pitches, 2023 through 2026-09-09, regular seasons verified per team at 162
games. 2024 shows 2,429 games, which is correct: HOU @ CLE on 2024-09-29, the
regular-season finale, was rained out and never made up.

A corrupted database under-reported its own row count by 23,523 pitches with no
error raised — counts and most queries still worked. `PRAGMA quick_check` now
runs after every scheduled refresh for exactly this reason.
